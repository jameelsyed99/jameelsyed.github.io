       <h2 class="hireM">Hiring Manager</h2>
       <p>Dear Reader,</p>


       <p>I am writing to express my interest in continous learning and growth, no matter what stage of my life.
       With a strong technical background, proven leadership experience, and a commitment to innovation, I am confident that 
       my skills and qualifications would make me a valuable asset to your team.</p>
       <br/>
       <p>As a Computer Science student with a diverse range of skills, I have experience in various programming languages including C,
       C++, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Python. My technical proficiency is complemented by my deep understanding of software development,
       database management, and web programming, which I have continuously honed through coursework and hands-on experience. Additionally, I have
       a strong foundation in ethical hacking, system architecture, and networking, making me well-equipped to contribute to the security and
       scalability of your software solutions.</p>
       <br/>
       <p>My professional experience has further developed my leadership and project management skills.
       In my current role as a Supervisor at Worldwide Flight Services, I lead a team of 25-35 individuals,
       overseeing daily logistics and transportation operations. This role has taught me how to manage high-pressure situations,
       optimize processes, and drive team efficiency, which are qualities I am eager to apply to a technology-focused role. As a
       Quality Assurance & Technical Project Manager at Axiom, I have collaborated on various software, cloud, and mobile development projects,
       where I have refined my skills in Agile methodologies, sprint planning, and cross-functional collaboration. These experiences have strengthened
       my ability to manage and prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining focus on quality and customer satisfaction.</p>
       <br/>
       <p>My goal is to bring my technical expertise, leadership abilities, and passion for technology
       to a forward-thinking team like yours. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's growth and
       help deliver innovative products that make a meaningful impact. I thrive in collaborative settings and look forward to the possibility
       of working with a team that shares my dedication to continuous improvement and cutting-edge technology.</p>
       <br/>
       <p>In the header to the right is my resume linked for your review. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background,
       skills, and experiences align with the needs of your team. Thank you for considering my application.
       I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.</p>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <p>Sincerely,</p>
       <p><i>Jameel Syed</i></p>
